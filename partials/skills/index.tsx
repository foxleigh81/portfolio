          I unfortunately, donâ€™t (yet) have a robot who will bring me pizza. but
          what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have
          acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me an asset for
          people like you.

          You can use the nifty little widget on the left to view a list of my
          skills. The colours represent how much skill and experience I have in
          them.
