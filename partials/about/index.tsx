        <p>
          Im a senior front-end engineer and technical lead, with a focus on
          building scalable, high-performance web apps and helping the teams
          behind them to do their best work. I care just as much about the
          architecture and developer experience as I do about the final product.
        </p>

        <p>
          React, Next.js, Node.js, and Storybook are my tools of choice, I love
          to create design systems and reusable component libraries that
          actually make life easier for the whole team. I like to get stuck in
          from start to finish, shaping the technical direction, mentoring devs,
          and making sure what we&apos;re building is fast, maintainable and
          enjoyable to use.

          I&apos;m big on accessibility, usability, and keeping things up to
          proper web standards â€” basically, building things that work well for
          everyone, while keeping an eye on both the tech needs and the bigger
          business goals.
