## Roadmap

- Add extra mini-me's such as an 'in-bed' one, one wearing a t-shirt and others that make sense for the situations.
- Animations! I plan to learn how to animate SVG's and have the mini-me's performing simple actions, such as blinking, waving, smiling, etc...
- Eventually, I'd like to create different components for different body parts, allowing me to easily switch heads, bodies etc...
