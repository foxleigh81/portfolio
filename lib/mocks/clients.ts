    description: `<p>My role here was as the founder and head of the &apos;Standards team&apos; for a major Intelligence Services commission. It was a series of projects to allow workers within the UK Intelligence services to be able to perform day-to-day operations without having to travel to a secure site and thus enabling remote work.</p>
    <p>My role here was to develop a coding standard and a framework application which allowed for developers to create highly performant and accessible applications from a single codebase, this resulted in &apos;The Wellspring&apos;, which is a NextJS application which uses Storybook and a &apos;storybook-driven-development&apos; approach to creating applications. This considerably increased the quality and speed of our application development process as well as greatly speeding up onboarding process for new developers.</p>
    <p>In addition, my duties also heavily involved mentoring and supporting other members of the commission.</p>
